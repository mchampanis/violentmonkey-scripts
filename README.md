# Scripts for violentmonkey

- developed on macOS Firefox, presumably should work on any browser/OS that supports the violentmonkey browser extension
- scripts might work with TamperMonkey, but [violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) is the preferred extension (open source and actively maintained).

## `windy-webcam-remove.js`

remove webcam results when searching locations in Windy. I find them annoying when you are trying to search and open weather predictions for a city.

## `zyxel-1password-complete.js`

Zyxel internet routers have terrible Javascript that does not behave properly with 1Password (a password manager). This is a bit of a hack to fix things enough to allow the 1Password extension to work and fill in your saved details.
